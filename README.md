# FEA20

This project mainly revolves around my experiments with geomechanics. My primary aim is to create a universal FEA solver that can be used to test different material models. I believe this tool will help enhance my understanding of soil behavior in various scenarios, and I’m glad if it fits your purposes as well.

I’m open to any advice and help, as I have very little programming experience. However, I come from a background in geotechnical civil engineering, which gives me a solid foundation for this project.
